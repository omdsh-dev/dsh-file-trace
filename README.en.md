# @dsh-external/dsh-file-trace

A DSH Web UI file-trace plugin: like Codex / Claude Code, it **records and reviews every file the model reads, writes, or edits**. A "File trace" button (with an operation-count badge) appears in the session-header utilities; clicking opens a floating window that lists all operations grouped by file, and selecting one shows the numbered content or a **line-by-line diff**. Zero core changes — a pure browser-half plugin.

> **Pick the plugin version that matches your DSH** (a mismatch crashes: common symptom `useConversation is not a function`)
> - DSH **0.1.1-rc.2**: this plugin targets **alpha.x** only; no version for rc.2
> - DSH **0.1.2-alpha.1 / alpha.2 / alpha.3 / alpha.4 / alpha.5 / rc.1**: install the **new** version (the default command below)
## Install (profile mode)

```sh
# Option 1: pinned-tag git dependency (public mirror, recommended; github:omdsh-dev/dsh-file-trace also works)
dsh plugin --profile web add '@dsh-external/dsh-file-trace@github:omdsh-dev/dsh-file-trace#v0.3.26'

# Option 2: local link (development; cloned repos ship build artifacts, rebuild with pnpm run build after edits)
git clone https://github.com/omdsh-dev/dsh-file-trace.git
cd dsh-file-trace && pnpm install
dsh plugin --profile web add link:/path/to/dsh-file-trace
```

Config line (`$DSH_HOME/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml`, hot-reloaded, no restart needed):

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: dsh-file-trace
      name: '@dsh-external/dsh-file-trace'
```

> **Install tips**: pnpm 11 may block node-pty build scripts on first install — run `pnpm approve-builds --all` under `~/.dsh/profiles/web` and re-run the install; then **hard-refresh the browser** (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R).

### Prompt install (let DSH install it)

Paste this prompt into any DSH session and the agent installs it for you:

> Install the dsh-file-trace plugin (DSH file trace: records and reviews model file reads/writes/edits with diffs):
> 1. Run `dsh plugin --profile web add '@dsh-external/dsh-file-trace@github:omdsh-dev/dsh-file-trace#v0.3.26'` (the first run may fail because pnpm 11 blocks node-pty build scripts)
> 2. Under `~/.dsh/profiles/web`, run `pnpm approve-builds --all` (approve the build scripts)
> 3. Re-run the install command from step 1
> 4. Append the `- insert` plugin row (id: dsh-file-trace, name: '@dsh-external/dsh-file-trace') to `~/.dsh/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml`, then remind me to hard-refresh the browser (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R)

## Features

- **Operation recording**: extracts the model's file reads / writes / edits with running, error, timestamp, and payload-size markers (recursively covering subCalls of host tools such as run_code).
- **Read view**: shows the real file content with **its real line numbers** (the DSH read-tool envelope is stripped).
- **Markdown reading mode + Mermaid**: operations on `.md / .markdown / .mdx` files show a Reading/Raw toggle in the pane header (available for read, write, and edit alike); reading mode renders the full document in **Obsidian style** — headings, tables (with alignment), thematic breaks, bold/italic/bold-italic, strikethrough, `==highlight==`, inline code, code fences, blockquotes, ordered/unordered lists and task checkboxes, links, and `[[wiki links]]`; images render by URL, while local-path images and non-image attachments show a unified file chip with the file name; YAML frontmatter renders as a code block. Edits reconstruct the resulting full document from the in-window prior content when known.
- **Mermaid diagram rendering (lazy + sanitized + zoom)**: ```mermaid fences in reading mode lazy-load the mermaid chunk from the host `/dsh-file-trace/resources` route (single-file bundle) and render as diagrams; beyond `securityLevel: strict` + `htmlLabels: false`, the emitted SVG passes a **zero-dependency whitelist sanitizer** (foreignObject/script/event attributes/all links stripped) before innerHTML; **click a diagram for the fullscreen zoom modal** (wheel zoom, drag pan, ±/0 keys, Esc or overlay-click close); import or render failure falls back to the plain code block.
- **Math formula rendering (KaTeX, lazy)**: `$$...$$` display blocks and `$...$` inline formulas in reading mode are typeset for real via a lazily-loaded katex chunk from the host `/dsh-file-trace/resources` route (single-file bundle, CSS and all fonts inlined as base64; one load covers the whole document) — subscripts/superscripts, fractions, radicals, Greek letters, \mathrm/\sqrt/\times/\quad all render; `throwOnError: false` keeps a bad formula a red-text annotation instead of breaking the page; on chunk-load failure the view falls back to the raw source text (the pre-0.3.14 behavior) — degrade, never crash.
- **Unified error display**: opening a failed read / write / edit shows the real error text from the result (a red error block) instead of a fabricated diff.
- **Syntax highlighting**: detects common languages by extension (C/C++, Java, C#, JS/TS incl. mjs/cjs/mts/cts, Python, Go, Rust, shell, cmd/batch, PowerShell, JSON/JSONC/JSON5/YAML/TOML/INI, SQL, CSS/SCSS/Less, HTML/XML/SVG/Vue, GraphQL, LaTeX/TeX (TeXstudio-style basic highlighting), …) and colors **keywords / strings / numbers / types / functions / comments / preprocessor directives** in the read view and diff rows; on modified lines the intra-line change tint stacks on top.
- **Write view**: a new-file write shows as **all-added (every line a green +)**; an overwrite shows the true del/add.
- **Edit view (hunk context folding)**: reconstructs the full file from an earlier in-window write/read, keeps **±3 lines of context** around the change, and folds unchanged large regions (**only runs of ≥3 lines**; ≤2-line runs stay visible) into a "… N lines" run (click to expand/collapse).
- **Long-line folding**: a single line over 120 chars folds to an ellipsis; click to expand/collapse.
- **Terminal-style diff**: monospace, line-number gutter, and **red (deleted) / green (added) / blue (modified)** font colors (backgrounds are only a softened tint for readability).
- **Ctrl+wheel font sizing**: the op-list area and the file-content pane (diff/read views) size independently (Ctrl + mouse wheel, each persisted to localStorage); clamped to 9–28px with a "minimum/maximum font size reached" toast at the bounds.
- **Floating window (draggable / resizable / right-edge docking)**: drag the header to move, drag the left/bottom edges to resize (position and size persist in localStorage); **release the drag near the right screen edge to snap it into a full-height right sidebar while the main conversation shifts left with no overlap — drag the header again to undock**; a separate handle above the diff pane adjusts the list/diff split.
- **Compatibility self-diagnosis**: the apply body probes the client APIs it needs; if absent it renders a remediation banner instead of crashing. A render-error boundary likewise surfaces the fix hint if the component throws.

## How it works

- Data is derived entirely from the session Chat view snapshot (`views.get('chat').legacy` tool-result nodes and runningCalls) — a pure derivation each render, no store, no listeners; refresh/paging stays aligned with the loaded window.
- The diff is a line-level LCS; a del-run followed by an add-run pairs as mod (rewritten).
- Registered into `conversation.session.header.utilities` (a session-scoped list slot via `ctx.slots.inject`).

## Version compatibility

| Plugin version | DSH version | Notes |

| `v0.3.25` (default) | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.5`, `rc.1`, `0.1.3-alpha.1`–`0.1.7-rc.1`, `0.1.7-rc.2`, `0.2.0-rc.1`, `0.2.0-rc.2` | **Performance fix under streaming output**: ① per-node identity-cached extraction (a stable tool-result is parsed/joined once, not once per streaming delta); ② element-identity `eq` on the conversation subscription — text streaming that settles no new file op skips the re-render entirely; ③ drag/resize gestures write styles straight to the DOM during the gesture and commit state on release (dragging stays responsive under render storms); also fixes a pre-existing bug where the persisted localStorage position was the pre-drag one. typecheck/115 tests/build green, live-verified mid-gesture following + correct persistence |
| `v0.3.24` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.5`, `rc.1`, `0.1.3-alpha.1`–`0.1.7-rc.1`, `0.1.7-rc.2`, `0.2.0-rc.1`, `0.2.0-rc.2` | **better-sidebar native tab (dual mount)**: when the `ctx.betterSidebar` service is present the trace panel also registers as a native sidebar tab (`dsh-file-trace:trace`, embedded static layout, data from the same session conversation source as the header trigger); without better-sidebar the floating window stays as-is (optional peer, registration safely skipped). typecheck/114 tests/build green, verified live on web (tab list + line diff + dual mount coexisting; rows v0.3.15–v0.3.23 are recorded in the Chinese README) |
| `v0.3.14` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.5`, `rc.1`, `0.1.3-alpha.1`–`0.1.6-alpha.1` | **Math rendering**: `$$`/`$` formulas in the Markdown reading mode are typeset for real via a lazily-loaded katex chunk (single file, fonts inlined as base64), falling back to raw text on load failure; typecheck/105 tests/build green, chunk route verified 200 on the live host; takes effect after a host restart (rows v0.3.11–v0.3.13 are recorded in the Chinese README) |
| `v0.3.6` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.5`, `rc.1`, `0.1.3-alpha.1`, `0.1.3-alpha.2` | Declare support for 0.1.3-alpha.2 (published on npm, pinned-version real-host verified; alpha.2 changes sit on the pi-ai / web-header / subagent-messaging / host planes - zero code delta on this plugin's client surface; typecheck/build/tests green) |
| `v0.3.10` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.5`, `rc.1`, `0.1.3-alpha.1`–`0.1.5-alpha.2` | Declares support for 0.1.5-alpha.2 (published on npm, pinned-version real-host verified; alpha.2 changes are sidebar document previews, model file delivery, minimal default tools, and the `fs-ext` install fix — zero code delta on this plugin's client surface; typecheck/build/105 tests green, boot manifest confirms loading) |
| `v0.3.9` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.5`, `rc.1`, `0.1.3-alpha.1`–`0.1.5-alpha.1` | Declares support for 0.1.5-alpha.1 (published on npm, pinned-version real-host verified; 0.1.5 changes sit in session format V3 / ctx.agent removal / host bundle serving route, zero code delta on this plugin's client surface; typecheck/build/105 tests green, boot manifest confirms loading) |
| `v0.3.8` | same as v0.3.7 | **SVG render preview**: a Render/Raw toggle on `.svg` op previews with a three-level source chain (host asset route bytes → session payload blob after DOMParser validation → sandboxed iframe fallback, scripts blocked, SMIL animations intact); local `.svg` embeds in markdown reading mode render as images instead of file chips; invalid payload XML shows an explicit error instead of a silent broken image |
| `v0.3.7` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.5`, `rc.1`, `0.1.3-alpha.1`, `0.1.3-alpha.2` | Fix: a document starting with a `---` divider followed by a later divider swallowed the heading and body as YAML frontmatter (client renderer fix, DSH-independent) |
| `v0.3.4` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.5`, `rc.1`, `0.1.3-alpha.1` | **PDF render preview**: `.pdf` ops (read / write / edit) gain a Render/Raw toggle — the file bytes stream through the host asset route into an explicitly-typed `application/pdf` Blob, opened by the browser's native PDF viewer; absolute paths only (a relative op path cannot locate the session workspace) |
| `v0.3.3` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.5`, `rc.1`, `0.1.3-alpha.1` | **HTML render preview**: `.html`/`.htm`/`.xhtml` op previews gain a Render/Raw toggle — a sandboxed iframe (allow-scripts, no same-origin) renders the (redacted) document — animations/interactions run isolated in an opaque origin; relative-path assets do not resolve (a deliberate security trade-off, see Known limitations) |
| `v0.3.2` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.5`, `rc.1`, `0.1.3-alpha.1` | Declare support for 0.1.3-alpha.1 (not on npm yet; verified on a source-launched host; 0.1.3 breaking changes sit on the host/session plane — zero code delta on this plugin's client surface; typecheck/build/96 tests green) |
| `v0.3.1` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.5`, `rc.1` | Docs update: clarify the redaction layer's positioning — display-layer convenience (screenshots / sharing), not a security boundary; session logs keep raw content |
| `v0.3.0` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.5`, `rc.1` | **Secret redaction layer**: sensitive paths mask whole files (`.env`/`*secret*`/`*credential*`/`*token*`/`*api-key*`/private keys…) and ordinary files mask secret-shaped spans (`api_key:`/`Bearer `/`sk-`/`AKIA`/`ghp_`/PEM headers…); applied uniformly across diff, read view, markdown mode, and error text; on by default with a one-click toolbar toggle (persisted in localStorage); display-only — session logs are untouched |
| `v0.2.9` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.5`, `rc.1` | Declares rc.1 support (alpha.5→rc.1 is version-bump-only, zero code diff; verified on rc.1) |
| `v0.2.8` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.5` | LaTeX/TeX syntax highlighting (TeXstudio-style: commands as macro, math as string, % comments, structure tokens, 200+ keywords) |
| `v0.2.7` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.5` | Declares alpha.5 support (typecheck/build green; alpha.5 is a pure bug-fix, no API change) |
| `v0.2.6` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.4` | Declares alpha.4 support (typecheck/build/79 tests green) |
| `v0.2.5` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.3` | Update prompt gains DSH-version tag routing + troubleshooting pointers |
| `v0.2.4` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.3` | Mermaid render hardening (htmlLabels:false + SVG whitelist sanitizer) + click-to-zoom modal |
| `v0.2.3` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.3` | Lazy mermaid rendering (code-block fallback); new host chunk-resource route |
| `v0.2.2` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.3` | Highlight expansion (mjs/cjs/mts/cts, CSS/SCSS/Less, HTML/XML/SVG/Vue, GraphQL, JSONC/JSON5) + Ctrl+wheel per-area font sizing (9–28px with bound toasts) |
| `v0.2.0` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.3` | Markdown reading mode (Obsidian-style rendering, toggle on read/write/edit) |
| `v0.1.8` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`–`alpha.3` | Update-endpoint auth (x-dsh-plugin-update header + same-origin) and hostChanged detection |
| `v0.1.7` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1` | Syntax highlighting (multi-line block comments included); unified real-error display; fold-expansion alignment fix; version tracks the tag | 
| `v0.1.6` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1` | Host-same-origin version check; scroll position memory | 
| `v0.1.4` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1` | Auto version check + click-to-update |
| `v0.1.3` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1` | Right-edge docking into a sidebar with main-conversation avoidance; typecheck, 20 unit tests, build all green |
| `v0.1.2` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1` | Floating window (drag / resize / persistence) |
| `v0.1.1` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1` | Hunk fold threshold ≥3 lines; red error read view; render-error boundary |
| `v0.1.0` | `dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1` | First version; source-built install, not published to npm |

- Targets **`dsh-v0.1.2-alpha.1`** (GitHub tag, source-built install).
- This version's breaking Client rework (removal of `dsh-client-runtime`, Conversation view refactor) is adapted in-tree, with a self-diagnostic banner as a fallback.

## Usage

1. Click "File trace" in the session-header utilities.
2. The window lists operations grouped by file (newest first); select one (`.md` files offer a Reading toggle that renders the document; Raw switches back):
   - **read** → numbered file content (errors render as a red block);
   - **write** → all-added (green +) or true del/add;
   - **edit** → ±3 context lines around the change, with "… N lines" folds above/below.
3. Long lines (>120 chars) toggle on click; "… N lines" runs expand/collapse on click.
4. Drag the header to move the window; **release near the right screen edge to dock it as a right sidebar** (the main conversation shifts left automatically), drag again to undock; drag the left/bottom edges to resize.
5. Esc or the close button dismisses the window.

## Known limitations

- Covers only the loaded window's operations, matching the Chat view; paging fills in as it loads.
- The edit "full-file context" relies on an earlier in-window write/read of the **same file**; otherwise only the model-provided old_string/new_string snippet is shown.
- Line-level diff plus intra-line (character-level) highlighting; syntax highlighting is a lightweight regex tokenizer (no syntax tree) with multi-line block-comment state threaded in line order, so complex constructs may be imprecise.
- **Redaction layer positioning (not a security boundary)**: redaction applies only to this plugin's rendering layer, as a convenience for **screenshots and sharing diffs with others**; it is not a security boundary — raw content remains fully present in the session logs, and any plugin or tool that can read session files sees unredacted content. To truly protect secrets, handle them at the source (credential management, file permissions).
- **HTML render preview security trade-off**: the iframe uses `sandbox="allow-scripts"` (**scripts allowed**, no same-origin, no forms/popups) — page animations and interaction logic run (the page's own fallback/error handling works too), inside an **opaque origin**: no access to the DSH host page's DOM/storage/cookies and no same-origin requests. `srcDoc` has no base URL, so **relative-path assets (images/CSS/same-directory fetches) do not resolve** (absolute http(s) still loads) — pages depending on sibling local files fall back to their own logic. The render input passes through the redaction layer like every other view, but it renders the document content the model read — do not treat the render view as a trusted-HTML execution environment.
- **Redaction × mermaid known edge**: in the markdown reading mode, when an **unquoted** mermaid node label contains a redacted secret (the masked `[REDACTED]` carries nested brackets), that diagram fails to parse and falls back to source text (no secret leaks; only the picture is lost). **Workaround**: always quote node labels (`A["text"]`); quoted labels survive masking. Turning redaction off also restores rendering. Session logs always keep the original bytes — redaction affects display only.
- The zh/en bilingual consistency record lives in `README.i18n.yaml`.
